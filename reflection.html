                <h3>Problems</h3>
                <p>While working on the website, layout became a big problem for me 
                    due to some of the grids not operating I had intended them to do.<br/>
                    Another issue I ran into was the redundancy of formatting my code 
                    aesthetically pleasing to my eye (i.e. paragraphs aligned "perfectly").<br/>
                    Along with alignment, I did have an issue with my Bizet page not
                    aligning the same way as the diagram OR the other pages.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="solutions">
                <h3>Solutions</h3>
                <p>Thankfully the layout issues were solved beccause I  was able
                    redo the entire container/div setup for each HTML page.<br/>
                    I could not do much about the redundancy issue because I had thrown
                    all the composer information into each page before properly laying it
                    out.<br/>
                    The last aligning problem with the Bizet is something I had to
                    let go of or I would have worried myself until my hair turns grey.<br/>

                <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, Bootstrap was a pretty simple framework to work with.
                    I will say that I am a little confused on how to implement the examples
                    that are mentioned on the website (headings, heroes, etc.).<br />
                    Bootstrap had a lot of other creative options I am interested
                    in working with in the future.
